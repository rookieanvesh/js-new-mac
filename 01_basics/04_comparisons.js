//always compare same data types
// equality and comparison operators work differently 
console.log(null==0);//false
console.log(null>=0);//true
//undefined is also similar ot this but it gives false values to all the operations
// === is called a strict check,it not only checks the value but also the data types
//we should mostly avoid these type of conversions
